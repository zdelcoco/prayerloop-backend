# Changelog

All notable changes to the Prayerloop backend API will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project uses a date-based versioning scheme: `[year].[month].[sequence]`
(e.g., 2025.11.3 is the third release in November 2025).

## [2026.2.1] - 2026-02-06

### Added

- **Prayer Comments System** (Phase 7)
  - `POST /prayers/:id/comments` - Create comment with prayer access checks
  - `GET /prayers/:id/comments` - Fetch comments with privacy filtering
  - `PUT /prayers/:id/comments/:commentId` - Update comment text
  - `DELETE /prayers/:id/comments/:commentId` - Hard delete comment
  - `PATCH /prayers/:id/comments/:commentId/hide` - Soft delete for moderation
  - `PATCH /prayers/:id/comments/:commentId/privacy` - Toggle private/public visibility
  - Dual-moderator pattern: prayer creator and linked subject can both moderate
  - Privacy filtering at SQL layer (private comments visible to owner + moderators only)
  - Comment text max 500 characters enforced on backend
- **Comment Notifications** (Phase 7)
  - `PRAYER_COMMENT_ADDED` notification type with 15-minute debounce batching
  - Recipient deduplication (creator + subject + previous commenters, self-excluded)
  - `target_comment_id` field for deep-linking to specific comments
- **Prayer Analytics** (Phase 8)
  - `POST /prayers/:id/analytics` - Record prayer event with 5-minute cooldown
  - `GET /prayers/:id/analytics` - Fetch aggregate analytics (total prayers, unique users)
  - Upsert pattern for analytics records (INSERT or UPDATE atomically)
  - Returns 200 with existing data during cooldown (silent ignore, not error)
  - Zero-value defaults when no analytics record exists

### Changed

- **Group Creation** (Phase 9) - Auto-creates prayer_subject contact card with type='group' on group creation
- **Prayer Sharing** (Phase 9) - Auto-creates user access when sharing to group, fixing share-to-self regression
- **Prayer Queries** (Phase 9) - Added comment_count aggregation via LEFT JOIN on prayer endpoints
- **Contact Cards** (Phase 6) - Group member endpoint returns phone number and email via LEFT JOIN with user_profile
- **Notification Deep Linking** (Phase 7.1) - Group context added to `PRAYER_EDITED_BY_SUBJECT` notifications for navigation
- Both group auto-creation operations are non-fatal (log error but don't block primary operation)

### Database

- `023_add_prayer_comment.sql` - Created `prayer_comment` table with `is_private` and `is_hidden` flags; added `target_comment_id` to notification table
- `022_add_phone_email_to_prayer_subject.sql` - Added `phone_number` and `email` columns to `prayer_subject`
- `024_add_prayer_subject_id_to_group_profile.sql` - Links group to auto-created contact card

## [2026.1.1] - 2026-01-30

### Added

- **Prayer Edit History** (Phase 1)
  - `GET /prayers/:id/history` - Retrieve prayer edit history with actor names
  - Async history logging on prayer mutations (create, edit, delete, share, answer)
  - Action type detection (answered vs edited vs shared)
- **Subject Edit Authorization** (Phase 2)
  - Linked prayer subjects can now edit and delete prayers about them
  - Subject field protection (403 when attempting to change `prayer_subject_id`)
- **Notification System** (Phase 3)
  - `NotifyCircleOfPrayerShared` - Notifications to circle members on prayer share
  - `NotifySubjectOfPrayerCreated` - Notifications to linked subjects on prayer creation
  - `NotifyCreatorOfSubjectEdit` - Notifications when subject edits prayer, with 15-minute debounce
  - Notification muting per group (`mute_notifications` on `user_group`)
  - Notification target fields (`target_prayer_id`, `target_group_id`) for deep linking
  - Database notification records created alongside push notifications

### Fixed

- Stale `link_status` values on `prayer_subject` records (migration 017)
- NULL `mute_notifications` values backfilled on existing `user_group` records
- Notification timestamps converted from TIMESTAMP to TIMESTAMPTZ for timezone correctness

### Database

- `017_fix_stale_link_status.sql` - Fixed prayer_subject link_status values
